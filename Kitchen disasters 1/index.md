# Kitchen disater 1

The plan was to make a strawberry pie. This idea was inspired by seeing my good friend Sam playing celeste and struggling at catching strawberries. My intent was to make a pie for when she would finish the game to go along with the strawberry pie that Madeline makes for everyone at the end of the game.

Here is how it went.

## Doughbious starts

After looking up a recipe, I realise that most fruit pies are actually make from cold-baked crust. So I had to bake an empty pie and then fill it with strawberries. Fair enough. I pick a recipe for pie dough that I got from someone off twitter. Beside learning that _lard_ is a legit cooking ingredient nothing noteworthy happened.

A hint of doubt already started taking root when I casually thought "This dough is for apple pie. Is the crust for strawberry pie different? nah it must be the same, they use the same thing for meat pies at the store anyways". Dismissing this though turned out to be my first mistake.

After letting the dough rest for a while so it could get firmer, I start flattening it to fit my pie plate. After struggling a bit to get the right amount of dough on the countertop I finally manage to get a big enough surface that I can use. After much effort, and help from a spatula, I (barely) manage to lift the dough off the under-floured surface and slide onto my plate. Forgetting to put flour on my countertop didn't prove to be a fatal mistake, but it was my clue that this project wasn't going to go according to plan.

## Unexpected take-off

After pre-heating the oven I carefully place the prized dough into it. As my hands release the metallic edge of the plate my mind realizes that I have absolutely no clue about how long it takes to bake a pie crust with no filling. Thankfully this realisation didn't come at the expense of a burnt hand, only mild discomfort from leaving it in the oven a smidge longer than expected.

I close the door and start frantically looking up my recipe. It starts with "on a baked pie pastry shell" without any mention of how to get to this step. I run to my flatmate who used to be a pastry cook and ask mildly panicked "how long to bake a pie without the pie".  To which she reacts with the usual bewilderment to my questions and says "I don't know I usually make fruit pies with pieces of broken down cookies andâ€¦" I stop her in her tracks to avoid additional internal humiliation at the thought of using a _basic_, _peasant_ pastry dough recipe instead of _high grade_ _top tier_ cookie-based dough and just set a timer for 15 minutes.

I come back after the allocated time and check on my soon-to-be-pastry-shell, only to see an exact replica of "the scream" by Edvard Munch in the reflection of the oven window. My dough has started to rise and formed a dome in the bottom area, leaving no room for the future filling to inhabit. I rashly, but also doubtfully, grab the closest fork I find and start poking holes in the dough hoping the extra CO2 would escape and let the dome perform a safe emergency-landing.

At this point I seriously consider aborting the mission and cut my losses short. After all, only the flour and the lard have been wasted; the strawberries, and my will to live, are still intact.

## Nerfed area of effect

After waiting 20 more minutes I'm satisfied with the cooking status of the dough and it is now an empty receptacle for my diabetes-inducing filling. Except for one small detail: In baking, the dough has shrunk, leaving the circumference of the shell amputated by about an inch. This renders its ability to hold any filling as effective as coal mines replacing nuclear power to counter global warming.

At this point I _seriously_ consider cutting my loses right now and trying again tomorrow by combining my leftover pastry with new pastry. However, consulting my local food expert, it occurred to me that any attempt to save the existing shell would result in another pie that's essentially isomorphic to the original strawberry pie I set out to make. In other words: Sugar goes on pie, sugar good.

With this in mind, I start chopping up my strawberries in halves, placing them carefully on the surface of the crust without having them overlap but without exposing too much bare skin either (This kitchen is PEGI-12 after all).

After using about half my strawberries I turn to the recipe again which instructs to use a "quart" of fresh strawberries, without mentioning the unit of which we're taking a quarter. Some frantic googling and emergency cries didn't result in a satisfactory answer so I decided to simply use all the rest of my strawberries.

## The pot of doom

The recipe lists 3/4 cups of water, "the remaining of your strawberries", 1 cup of sugar and 3 tablespoons of cornstarch. After using my sharp diagonal-reading skill I pick up that I need to mash the berries in a bowl and add them to a saucepan with the rest of the ingredients. While I am not unfamiliar with mashing fruits into goop, it's the first time I did it to strawberries.

At the end it looked like a miniature invocation pool of blood with bits and pieces of monster organs floating around. Not deterred by the monstrosity I created I proceed to drop it in the closest (and only) saucepan we have, turn on the burner and bring the unholy mixture to a boil. However, while mixing up I noticed its level reached uncomfortably close to the top of the pan. In an accidental display of eagerness I stir the mixture a bit too strongly as to let it (prophetically) spill over.

After emergency-scrubbing the only suitable replacement I transpose the concoction with the same determination as Gruntilda from Banjo-Kazooie. Witnessing the release of some ominous fumes and dubious foam, I start to question my methods and start reviewing the recipe again.

That is when I notice two things:
- The water goes at the end
- The water is only there to accommodate for the 3 tablespoons of cornstarch

At this point there are only two courses of action:
- Abort everything and use the remain of this eldritch horror to nuke the kitchen
- Overshoot the amount of starch to make up for the extra water necessary to dilute the starch in this state.
Worried for the sanity of my flatmate I go for the second option, little did I know it would end up in a disaster different in nature but similar in scale as option 1.

I proceed to add 3.5 Tbps of cornstarch to a cup and fill it with just enough water to end up with a liquid mixture. However in my hurry I forget the properties of liquid cornstarch, that is when the entire city heard a scream saying "Oh fuck I forgot it's non-Newtonian". This realization rendered all my efforts to speed up the process moot, so I resolved to stirring slowly and gently despite the circumstances. Playing with such alien physical properties proved very enjoyable, however the situation didn't allow me to enjoy it for too long. I carefully dropped the liquid in my boiling soup of dread and watch with anticipation the effect of my preparation.

# A Hellish battle

At first the boiling calmed down, which was a great sign that the water started to get thicker. It seemed like my devilish plan worked, however after a couple stirs I notice those worryingly big white growths swimming in my glucose mixture. "Those better be dead" I think as I start crushing them with a spatula.

It turns out the heat cooked the outside of the liquid cornstarch, sealing the reminder inside, unable to dilute with the rest of the water. Realizing that no amount of spatula bashing will help my cause I turn to advanced technology and power tools. However what I didn't notice at the time was that my relentless fight against the white sea creatures spilt a big chunk of strawberry/sugar/starch, which stuck to the side of the pan and inevitably slid down into the hellish flames of the burner.

With my eyes filled with the determination of man conquering nature, I start traumatizing my creation with the mixer I just plugged in. Immediately, I start smelling something burnt. Extremely worried I had accidentally melted down my newfound tool, I turn off the heat and stubbornly keep grinding down the mixture. I turn on the heat again hoping it will help the mixture dilute more easily, but the burnt smell comes back. After what seemed like years of an endless battle between my miscarriage and the fire alarm I give up and let the ghostly shapes elect residence inside the pan.

Finally I use my spatula to scoop up the liquid,  carefully avoiding its inhabitants, and drop it in the seams of my atrophied pie.

# Epilogue

The pie is good.

Using dough from broken down cookies wouldn't have risen in the oven.

There was a third option that I didn't think of: scooping out half a cup of the mix and using it to mix wih the cornstarch. But it didn't cross my mind at the time, due to it requiring an extra step: letting the scooped up water cool down.

The burnt smell was due to the bit escaping, sticking to the side and the flames carbonizing the sugar off it.

The mixer didn't kill the pan but it killed me inside.

I still don't know what to do with my leftover pie pastry.
